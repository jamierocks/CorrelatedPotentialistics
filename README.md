# Correlated Potentialistics
Correlated Potentialistics is a digital storage mod for Minecraft. It's designed
to be extremely extensible and modular, and comes with a number of default
modules. Currently, these default modules cannot be removed, but in the future
they will be removable instead of just disablable.

As CoPo is a series of mods, sharing the "Correlated" prefix, it'll be referred
to as Correlated here. CoPo is more of a legacy name from the original versions
of the mod.

This readme is an overview of the modules. For player documentation, check out
[the Wiki](https://github.com/elytra/CorrelatedPotentialistics/wiki).

## Current Modules

### Correlated Core
Correlated Core adds the basic functionality and items required for the other
modules. It does nothing on its own, but provides a robust API for extending the
storage system with support for virtually anything.

### Correlated Items
Adds item storage functionality to Correlated Core. Also serves as a good
example implementation of DigitalStorage.

### Correlated Wireless
Adds wireless componentry to Correlated Core, allowing you to link two distant
systems or just access a single system from a handheld device.

## Upcoming Modules

### Correlated Fluids
Adds fluid storage functionality to Correlated Core.

### Correlated Wires
Adds wires to Correlated Core, instead of only allowing contact.

### Correlated Thaumistry
Adds essentia storage to Correlated Core.

### Correlated Crafting
Adds autocrafting to Correlated Core.

### Correlated Spatial
Adds spatial storage (i.e. blocks) to Correlated Core, allowing you to move
structures elsewhere or just keep them in limbo for a while.

### Correlated Factory
Adds a number of processing machines. When installed, Enderic Processors cannot
be found in dungeon chests.
